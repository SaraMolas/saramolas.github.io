Sara Molas Medina, PhD
**Researcher working on mechanistic interpretability and representation learning, with a background in computational neuroscience and biology.**

I study how complex systems internally represent structure.

My training began in Biomedical Sciences and Systems & Computational Neuroscience, where I analyzed high-dimensional neural recordings to understand how spatial and contextual information is encoded in the brain.

More recently, I have applied this representational lens to artificial neural networks. Through mechanistic interpretability research, including sparse autoencoders, ablation studies, and training-dynamics analysis, I've investigated how representations emerge and interact in deep learning systems.

I am particularly interested in bridging biological and artificial systems: developing tools that make large-scale models more transparent, and applying mechanistic analysis to models trained on biological data. My goal is to make foundation models more interpretable and scientifically useful.
