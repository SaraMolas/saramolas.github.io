**Computational Neuroscience x Mechanistic Interpretability x Deep Learning x Biomedical Sciences**

I am a researcher trained in Biomedical Sciences and Computational Neuroscience, now focusing on mechanistic interpretability of deep learning models.

My work sits at a rare intersection:

- I understand biological systems at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels.
- I have led independent research on internal representations in biological neural populations.
- I train and mechanistically analyze modern deep learning models.

I am particularly interested in making large models trained on biological data more transparent, reliable, and scientifically meaningful.
